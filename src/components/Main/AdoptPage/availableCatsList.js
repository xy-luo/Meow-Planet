To be honest, I'm a bit of a wallflower, but if you've got a soft voice, gentle hands, and a caring heart, I'll totally warm up to you and show my sweet and affectionate side. And once I get comfortable, there's nothing I love more than a good belly rub! And I'm still young enough to enjoy a good play session. Laser lights, wand toys, pipe cleaners. So fun! So if you're looking for a new feline friend, come visit me soon!"

I don't need too much petting but would love to hang out on the couch near you. Ready to binge watch some good shows? I'm down. Maybe a few head and neck pets during the breaks? I just need a kind person who is willing to be patient. Outside of that, I swear my good looks will win you over when you look into my pretty face. Come down and visit soon!"

Once he's transitioned into a new place, he loves to explore and run around. He was living outside for awhile, but also enjoys the comfortable aspects of indoor living. He'll be a great lap cat and a great companion to follow you around the garden as you work. Come down to HSSV and meet him! He would love to show you around his big and spacious outdoor space, while he waits to go to his forever home."

I'm a fun girl that likes to be where the action is, whether it's playing with the wand toy or relaxing on the couch. I enjoy rubbing against my human's leg and making biscuits while getting pets. I would love to have a window perch to stare at all those lovely birds outside. I do have a bunch of energy when playing so I'm still working on all my 'polite' adult manners. As much as I enjoy the humans at HSSV, it's time for me to have a home to roam around. Come and ask an adoption counselor to see me today. I have a special room in the back, since it has more space and a lot less commotion. So just ask a staff member to see me."
